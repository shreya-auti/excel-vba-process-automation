# Data Analysis — Equipment Inventory Optimization (Excel)

## Overview

This project demonstrates a structured approach to **cleaning, validating, and analyzing operational data** using Microsoft Excel.
The goal was to transform a raw, error-prone equipment dataset into **decision-ready insights** using reproducible analysis techniques.

The focus is not on dashboards—but on **data integrity, aggregation logic, and analytical correctness**, which are prerequisites for any reliable business decision.

## Objectives

* Clean and normalize a multi-department equipment dataset
* Remove inconsistencies that distort reporting
* Aggregate equipment counts by department and equipment class
* Enable comparative analysis through pivot tables

## Tools & Techniques

* **Microsoft Excel**
* Filters & Sorting
* Conditional Formatting
* Remove Duplicates
* Flash Fill
* Structured Tables
* Pivot Tables (multi-level aggregation)

## Data Preparation & Cleaning

Key data-quality issues addressed:

* **Column standardization** for readability and consistency
* **Removal of empty rows** using filters
* **Duplicate detection and elimination**
* **Spelling corrections** in categorical fields
* **Whitespace normalization** (double spaces removed)
* **Department name reconstruction** using Flash Fill after source import errors

*Result: A clean, normalized dataset suitable for aggregation and reporting.*

## Analytical Tasks Performed

* Computed **SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT** for equipment data
* Created pivot tables to analyze:

  * Total equipment count by **department**
  * Equipment distribution by **class within departments**
  * Department distribution within **equipment classes**
* Sorted results to highlight **highest-impact categories**
* Collapsed pivot fields to isolate key insights

## Key Outputs

Screenshots of analytical outputs are available in the `/screenshots` folder:

* Cleaned and structured dataset
* Equipment count by department (Pivot Table)
* Equipment count by class and department (Pivot Table)

These outputs demonstrate **analytical rigor**, not cosmetic visualization.

## Why This Project Matters

This project reflects real-world analytical work:

* Data rarely arrives clean
* Errors silently distort metrics
* Decisions depend on correct aggregation logic

The work emphasizes **accuracy before aesthetics**—a critical mindset in analytics roles.

### Skills Demonstrated
